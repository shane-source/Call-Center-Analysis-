 📞 Call Center Performance Analytics

This project showcases a full analysis of a Call Center dataset using **MySQL** and **Excel**, designed to simulate the real-world role of a Data Analyst supporting customer service operations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Monitor daily and overall call performance
- Track SLA (Service Level Agreement) compliance
- Identify performance bottlenecks and peak load days
- Translate business KPIs into actionable SQL queries
- Build a dashboard to present insights visually

## 📈 Excel Dashboard

- Created pivot tables and slicers to analyze daily trends
- Visualized SLA breaches, abandon rates, and answer speeds
- Flagged critical dates where performance dropped below target

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **MySQL**: Querying and aggregation of raw call log data
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, visualization, dashboard creation

## 📌 Sample Insights

- SLA dropped below 80% on 6 days — potential staffing issue
- Days with high wait times also had high abandon rates
- July 10th had the highest call volume — worth investigating shift coverage

## 📂 Project Files

- `callcenter_queries.sql` — All SQL code used
- `dashboard.xlsx` — Excel dashboard & visual reports
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## ✅ Final Note

This project demonstrates how raw call center data can be transformed into **actionable insights** using just SQL and Excel — no BI tools needed. It reflects real business needs like SLA tracking, customer satisfaction, and operational improvement.
